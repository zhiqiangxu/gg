# gg - go generator, yet another generics workaround solution for go

Install:

```
go get github.com/zhiqiangxu/gg
```

Until Go2 finally comes, workaround for generics is necessary. **gg** can do what [`genny`](https://github.com/cheekybits/genny) can do in a cheaper way, no placeholder types like `generic.Type` is required.
